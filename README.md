# Word-Bomb-HTMLJS

An online recreation of a game named **Word Bomb**.

The dictionary is stored in *Alpha_words_stored.json*.
The dictionary is stored in a Succinct Trie structure, with code provided by Steve Hanov.

Steve Hanov's code for the Succinct Trie structure can be seen in SteveHanovSuccinctTrie.js and SteveHanovCodeSuccinctTrie.js, however, the code is slightly modified to make it compatible with the game (changed function parameters, and exported functions).


The game can be played at https://sy-gato.github.io/Word-Bomb-HTMLJS/
